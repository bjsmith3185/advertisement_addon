- when the user hovers over a <div> the app will scrape the <div> for keywords. 
- the data scraped will be saved into a database ( reference that <div> in some way).
- if the user hovers on the div for a set time (5sec) the app will respond by sending stored data
    in the form of an advertisement to the client-side.


- the information returned to the client-side can be in a popup/sidebar

- the databse of 'advertisements' will be saved using keywords "trucks, toys, etc"
- the scraper will search for keywords on the page and try to match up one or more of 
    those keywords with those stored in the 'advertisements' database.


- a way to track how many times an advertisement was used would be helpful


- Maybe a MERN app

- try using a mongodb
- use     to scrape the page


//--------------------

- a search bar at the top, enter a website
-  the page will display that website and also scrape it for keywords
have the homepage display a website on the left and the advserisement on the right

//-------------------

- create a search input box
- the keywords entered are collected
    - the left of page will display a box with that serach term
    - the right of page will display a related ad.
